# React Counter Component

A React component that demonstrates state management with configurable initial count, step size, and color theme.

## Interactive Playground

<ReactCounter initialCount={10} step={2} color="green" client:load />

<PlaygroundRenderer
  component="ReactCounter"
  controls={{
    initialCount: 'text',
    step: 'text',
    color: ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'purple'],
  }}
  client:load
/>

## Properties

- **initialCount** (`number`) - The starting count value (default: 0)
- **step** (`number`) - The increment/decrement step size (default: 1)
- **color** (`'blue' | 'green' | 'red' | 'purple'`) - The color theme for the buttons (default: 'blue')

## Behavior

This component maintains its own internal state and responds to button clicks. Note that when props are changed in the playground, the component will re-render and lose its current state, resetting to the new `initialCount` value.

## Usage

```astro
---
import ReactCounter from '../components/examples/ReactCounter.tsx';
---

<ReactCounter initialCount={10} step={2} color="green" client:load />
```

Make sure to include the `client:load` directive when using React components in Astro to enable client-side interactivity.

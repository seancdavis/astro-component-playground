title: Interactive Button Component
description: A button component with click event handling that shows alerts
---

import PlaygroundRenderer from '../../components/playground/PlaygroundRenderer.tsx';

A button component that includes interactive behavior with click event handling. This component demonstrates the limitations of the playground system - the interactive behavior will be lost when props are updated.

## Interactive Playground

<PlaygroundRenderer
  component="InteractiveButton"
  controls={{
    variant: ['primary', 'secondary', 'danger'],
    size: ['sm', 'md', 'lg'],
    children: 'text',
  }}
  client:load
/>

## Properties

- **variant** (`'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'`) - The visual style of the button
- **size** (`'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'`) - The size of the button
- **children** (`string`) - The text content of the button

## Behavior

When clicked, this button will show an alert with the button's text content. Note that after changing props in the playground, the click handler will be lost due to the component re-rendering via innerHTML replacement.

## Usage

```astro
---
import InteractiveButton from '../components/examples/InteractiveButton.astro';
---

<InteractiveButton variant="primary" size="md">
  Click me for an alert!
</InteractiveButton>
```
